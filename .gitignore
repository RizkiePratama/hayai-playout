# Rust / Cargo generated files
# ============================
# This is the most important rule. The target directory contains all build
# artifacts, dependencies, and binaries. It should NEVER be committed.
/target/

# Generated by 'cargo-fmt'
rustfmt.toml

# We are intentionally NOT ignoring Cargo.lock. For an application workspace
# like this, committing Cargo.lock is crucial because it guarantees that
# every developer and every build uses the exact same dependency versions,
# ensuring reproducible builds.


# IDE / Editor specific files
# ===========================
# Visual Studio Code
.vscode/
.history/
*.code-workspace

# Jetbrains (CLion, etc.)
.idea/

# Vim
*~
*.swp
*.swo

# Emacs

# OS generated files
# ==================
# macOS
.DS_Store
.AppleDouble
.LSOverride

# Windows
